I admit that I don't read as much as I would like. So this year, I have decided to improve my reading level. To do this, I've pledged to read 5 books for the [Goodreads 2021 Reading Challenge](https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/11650-2021-reading-challenge){:target="_blank"}!

The books I want to read in 2021 (not in any particular order):
1. [Radical Candor](https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Candor-Revised-Kick-Ass-Humanity/dp/1250235375){:target="_blank"}
2. [Washington: A Life](https://www.amazon.com/Washington-Life-Ron-Chernow/dp/0143119966){:target="_blank"}
3. [The Book Thief](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Thief-Markus-Zusak/dp/0375842209){:target="_blank"}
4. [The Five Dysfunctions of a Team](https://www.amazon.com/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Fable/dp/0787960756){:target="_blank"}
5. [18 Minutes: Find Your Focus, Master Distraction, and Get the Right Things Done](https://www.amazon.com/18-Minutes-Master-Distraction-Things/dp/0446583405){:target="_blank"}

I believe reading variety of subjects would also improve the writing so that is one of my goals for 2021. 

Wish me a luck!
